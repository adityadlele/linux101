Welcome to Linux 101
============================

Our aim for molecular simulations part of this course is for everyone to be able to run simulations. Most 
of the molecular simulation codes are run on computer clusters or so-called super compueters. This is a 
short introduction for using Princeton computing cluster resources for this course. This is by no means 
a comprehensive guide. I hope this will help you get started. Please report if you find any erros.
