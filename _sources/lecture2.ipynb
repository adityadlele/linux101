    "We discussed an MD simulation related to liquid Ar previously. In this simulations, we modeled Ar liquid at 85 K using XYZ atoms. If you consider a\n",
    "vessel full of liquid Ar with a volume of 10$^{-3}$ $m^3$, it will contain 1.4096 kg of Ar or 2.125*10$^{25}$ Ar atoms. Considering that this is a fluid,\n",
    "the arrangement of atoms is not periodic either. These atoms could arrange themselves in so many ways. If we chose any XYZ atoms from this vessel, \n",
    "we would find a very large number of configurations or states. The macroscopic properties that we observe are a result of average of these configurations.\n",
    "How does our system of XYZ atoms would predict the macroscopic properties? \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we can model a large number of configurations and then take an average to calculate the property of interest.\n",
    "However, a better solution is given by the ergodic hypothesis. It states that over long periods of time, all the states of \n",
    "the system are equiprobable. In other words, time average of a property is same as sampling multiple states. As you can imagine, this is \n",
    "really useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise x\n",
    "To test the ergodic hypothesis, use the MD code/LAMMPS to determine the density and/or velocity distribution of a system of XYZ Ar atoms\n",
    "as described earlier with MD simulation times of x, 10x and 100x ps. Sample the properties for every 100 timesteps with a timestep of x fs.\n",
    "Compare the calculated property with the experimental result of X.  \n",

    "## Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "Our MD simulations code described earlier conserved the number of particles (N), volume (V) and total energy (E) of the system. This is referred to \n",
    "as the NVE or the microcanonical ensemble. It is often more convinient to perform simulations at constant temperature or pressure. This is achieved through\n",
    "NVT and NPT ensembles respectively. Let us consider the NVT ensemle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, this emsemble is used to implement isothermal conditions. In this ensemble, the simulation system is kept in contact\n",
    " with a heat bath to maintain the temperature of the system. Note that the energy of the system is allowed to change. This effect is achieved using \n",
    "thermostats. Thermostats are the algorithms that part of every standard MD code used to maintain the temperature of the system. Anderson thermostat,\n",
    " Berendsen thermostat, Nose-Hoover thermostat, and Langevin (stochastic) thermostat are some of the popular examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to maintain the temperature of the system, an easy way would be to reassign the velocities of the atoms as per the temperature. The kinetic\n",
    " energy and particle velocity distribution of a system can be determined using Boltmann distribution for the given temeprature. We can fix the velocities\n",
    "of the particles at every time step as per this distribution to keep to total kinetic energy constant. However, this is not our aim. We want the system \n",
    "to behave as if in contact with a large heat bath. The above method could result in biasing the particle dynamics which could lead to unphysical results.\n",
    "We want the temperature of the system to be the desired temperature while allowing for local fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the example of the Berendsen thermostat. In this method the velocities are scaled at each time step so that the rate of \n",
    "change of temperature is proportional to the difference between the system temperature and the target temperature."
