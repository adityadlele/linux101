Practical Molecular Simulations
============================

Our aim for molecular simulations part of this course is for everyone to be able to run simulations relevnat to your research. Most 
of the molecular simulation codes are run on computer clusters or so-called super compueters. This is a Jupyter book that will be used throughout the course. This is by no means 
a comprehensive guide to molecular simulations. I hope this will help you get started. 

Please report if you find any erros. We will improve this book together so that the next set of users can benifit from it.
