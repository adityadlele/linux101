    "Static DFT or other ab-initio (Quantum chemistry) calculations provide us a lot of useful and very accurate information. However, atoms and molecules around us are in constant motion at finite temperatures.\n",
    " Molecular dynamics(MD) simulation techniques model this motion. The driving force behind the motion could be ab-intio calculations or empirical potentials. Several\n",
    " flavors of MD have been developed among ab-initio and classical techniques to tackle different type of processes. Empirical potentials can be further classified into reactive and \n",
