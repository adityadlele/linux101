Molecular dynamics basics
=========================

Static DFT or other ab-initio calculations provide us with a lot of useful and very accurate information. However, atoms and molecules around us are in constant motion at finite temperatures.
 Molecular dynamics(MD) simulation techniques model this motion. The driving force engine behind the motion could be ab-intio calculations or empirical potentials. Several
 flavors of MD have been developed among ab-initio and classical techniques to tackle different type of processes. Empirical potentials can be further classified into reactive and 
non-reactive potentials. Recently, an additional flavor of machine learning (ML) based potentials is also being developed.  Different molecular dynamics techniques have different 
levels of accuracy and uses.

## A simple example

Let us take a look at an example of a LJ potential to model the motion of an inert gas.





> This example has a historical significance. Aneesur Rahman, considered as one of the pioneers of molecular dynamics, used similar 
methods modelling motion of atoms in liquid Argon. This paper is generally considered to mark the beginnings of the molecular dynamics
 method. You can access the original paper [here](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.136.A405).
