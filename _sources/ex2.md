Exercise 2
==========

As everyone is working on their own simulation project, you are looking at literature to find research discussing
different types of molecular simulations. In this excersise, we will choose one such paper and make a small presentation.
This presentation should include the research idea, simulations methods, results and your take on the paper. You will need to make the following
a) 8-10 minute recording of a presentation on your chosen research paper
b) A LAMMPS tutorial for a simulation you are actually going to perform as a part of your project
