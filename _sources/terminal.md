# How to use the computing cluster

** 1. Getting started **
 
You can use the research computing website for a [comprehensive guide](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/get-started/guide-princeton-clusters)

or 

A shorter version:
There are two ways to access the Princeton computing cluster
- Access the compueter cluster using a command prompt. [Click here](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/connect-ssh)
- Access the cluster using web. **(I highly reccomend this if you are a beginer)**
To use the Open OnDemand web interface for Adroit, Della, or Stellar you must first have an account set-up for the cluster you wish to use. 
(For instructions on how to gain access, navigate to Adroit's(**for this class**) or other clusters webpage in the Systems submenu of the Research Computing site.) 
Once you have an account, you can browse to [Adroit](https://myadroit.princeton.edu).

Note that to access these links from off-campus you will need to use a [VPN](https://princeton.service-now.com/snap?id=kb_article&sys_id=ce2a27064f9ca20018ddd48e5210c745).

- The computer clusters runs Linux. So you will need learn basics of [linux](https://github.com/gabeclass/introcmdline).


**2. File system **

There are two types of file storages available for all the clusters. For adroit
1. /home/YourNetID **(You can store imporatant results here!)**
* For - source code and executables
* Details - This folder is small and it is intended for storing source code, executables, Conda environments, R or Julia packages and small data sets.

2.  /scratch/network/YourNetID **(You will run your jobs here!)**
* For - job output, intermediate results
* Details - This folder is a fast, parallel filesystem that is local to each cluster which makes it ideal for storing job input and output files. However, because /scratch/gpfs is not backed up you will need to transfer your completed job files to /tigress or /projects when a backup is desired.
