## Reactive potentials

## Setting up your simulation
Now that we have covered basic concepts behind molecular dynamics simulations, let us see how one can set-up a molecular dynamics
simulation. We are discussing this topic here in a general sense. You need to ask yourself several questions before spending your
valuable computational time on these simulations.

1. What do you want to simulate?
2. What accuracy do you desire?
3. What is the appropriate MD potential/method?
4. Finally, What is the appropriate MD simulation?

Once you answer these questions, your typical simulation setup will start with generating the desired geometry for the system. We already
tested this using ASE in excersize 0.
